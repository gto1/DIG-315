# Week 3 Build Lab

**Due Date:** End of Week 3 Sunday 11:59 PM  
**Points:** 50  
**Submission Format:** Your HTML and CSS code and any supporting files

### Learning Objectives
- Enhance your existing HTML from Weeks 1 or 2 by adding **basic, practical CSS** for styling and layout.  
- Practice using common CSS selectors (element, class, ID, pseudo-class) to control colors, fonts, positioning, and spacing.  
- Gain experience separating structure (HTML) from presentation (CSS).


### Overview
In this assignment, you‚Äôll take the same content or HTML structure you created in prior weeks (e.g., the ‚ÄúWeek 2 Semantic HTML‚Äù page) and apply **introductory CSS** rules. By the end, your webpage will look more polished and professional.


### Instructions

1. **Set Up Your Workspace**  
   - Inside your existing project folder (e.g., `DIG-315 Project`) or whatever yours is named, create a **new HTML file** for Week 3 named `portfolio.html` or something similar. Be sure you have the proper `.html`.  
   - Add in your basic HTML code to this file. Alternately, you can copy your `aboutus.html` code from Week 2 into this new file for a quick setup.  
   - Create a new file named `styles.css` in the same folder. At this point you should have at least your 3 `.html` files and also your new `styles.css` all in your one project folder.

2. **Link Your CSS**  
   - In the `<head>` section of `portfolio.html`, link your new stylesheet:
     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
     ```

3. **Basic Element Selectors**  
   - Use **element selectors** (e.g., `body`, `h1`, `p`, `section`, `footer`) in `styles.css` to set default styling. For example:
     ```css
     /* Element selectors */
     body {
       margin: 0;
       padding: 0;
       font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
       background-color: #f0f0f0;
     }

     h1, h2, h3 {
       color: #333;
       text-align: center;
     }

     p {
       color: #555;
       line-height: 1.5;
     }
     ```
   - Add margins, padding, or other basic rules to improve readability.

4. **Class & ID Selectors**  
   - Assign **class** or **id** attributes to specific elements in your HTML if you want to style them uniquely:
     ```html
     <header id="main-header">
       <h1>My Personal Blog</h1>
     </header>

     <section class="intro-section">
       <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>Paragraph text here...</p>
     </section>
     ```
   - In your `styles.css`, target them:
     ```css
     /* ID selector */
     #main-header {
       background-color: #222;
       color: #fff;
       padding: 1rem;
     }

     /* Class selector */
     .intro-section {
       background-color: #fff;
       padding: 2rem;
       margin: 1rem auto;
       max-width: 700px;
     }
     ```

5. **Styling Navigation**  
   - If you have a `<nav>` or menu links, style them to create a simple horizontal menu. For instance:
     ```css
     nav ul {
       list-style: none;
       display: flex; /* or inline-block / flex / or even float */
       justify-content: center;
       gap: 1rem;
       padding: 0;
       margin: 0;
       background-color: #333;
     }

     nav ul li a {
       color: #fff;
       text-decoration: none;
       padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
       display: inline-block;
     }

     /* Pseudo-class for hover effect */
     nav ul li a:hover {
       background-color: #555;
     }
     ```

6. **Positioning & Layout**  
   - Explore **basic positioning** or layout methods (using margins, padding, or `display` properties) to arrange sections on the page:
     ```css
     main {
       margin: 2rem auto;
       max-width: 800px;
       background-color: #fff;
       box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
     }

     aside {
       float: right;
       width: 30%;
       margin: 1rem;
       background-color: #fafafa;
     }
     ```
   - You can also try `display: flex;` for more advanced layouts if you feel comfortable.

7. **Color & Font Choices**  
   - Apply color schemes and fonts (either system fonts or from Google Fonts) to make your page unique:
     ```css
     body {
       background-color: #e6eeff; /* Soft background */
       font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; /* If you included this in your <head> */
     }

     h1 {
       color: #0066cc; /* Complementary color for headings */
     }
     ```
   - NOTE: You should only have `body`, `h1`, or any other CSS selector listed in your `styles.css` file, but you can simply add more properties and values to the one that you already have in your CSS.

8. **Optional Transition or Basic Animation**  
   - Add a **hover transition** on buttons or images:
     ```css
     img {
       transition: transform 0.3s;
     }

     img:hover {
       transform: scale(1.05);
     }
     ```
   - Keep it simple; we‚Äôll explore more robust CSS animations in future lessons.

9. **Test & Refine**  
   - **Open `portfolio.html` in your browser** to see if your CSS updates appear.
   - If it's working, GREAT üéâ -- Keep exploring and refining with various CSS that we've learned this week.
   - If it's not working ‚ùå -- Go back to the earlier steps and check:
      - Your `<link>` element is in your HTML files `<head>` section properly.
      - Your CSS syntax and structure (the grammar of your code)
   - GET CREATIVE!! Adjust the rules in `styles.css` until you‚Äôre happy with how the page looks.

10. **Add Your CSS To All of Your HTML Pages**  
   - Go back to your Week 1 and Week 2 HTML and add the `<link>` to your CSS files (Step #2 above) so that your CSS styles your entire site, not just one page.

11. **Submission**  
   - Submit your `index.html` and `styles.css` files to the LMS or your class repo.
   - Take a screen shot or screen video of your working site with CSS to share with the class.
   - **Due Date:** End of Week 3.
